      <p className="text-sm text-morselBrown/80">
        Marilyn&apos;s Morsels began in a home kitchen, where every batch was tested
        on brutally honest friends and family until the recipe was right every time.
        Today, each order is baked in a licensed home kitchen with the same care:
        real butter, premium chocolate, and a strict “no shortcuts” policy.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm text-morselBrown/80">
        We keep the menu focused so every morsel that leaves the oven is consistent:
        golden edges, soft centers, and flavors that actually justify reordering.
